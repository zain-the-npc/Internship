# ⌨️ Day 22 – Typing Speed Test: Streamlit Web App

This is a GUI-based typing speed test built using Streamlit. The app lets users select difficulty (easy, intermediate, or hard), type a passage, and get immediate feedback on their performance.

It calculates words per minute (WPM), accuracy, total errors, and highlights mistakes in real-time. The UI is responsive, colorful, and smooth, providing an interactive and beginner-friendly typing experience.
