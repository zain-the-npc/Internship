#  Day 20 â€“ Advanced Typing Speed Test (CLI)

This is a terminal-based typing test app built with Python that lets users practice and measure typing speed at different difficulty levels. 
It features easy, intermediate, and hard passages and uses a countdown to start the test.


The app calculates typing speed (WPM), accuracy, errors, and shows a side-by-side color-coded comparison of typed vs target text using `colorama`. 
It runs entirely in the terminal and is designed to give real-time feedback after the test.


All passages are imported from a separate file (`passages.py`), and the UI is styled with colored output for better experience.

ðŸ“Œ Run `main.py` to start the test. Choose a difficulty and begin typing!
