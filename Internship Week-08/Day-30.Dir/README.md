# Travel Agent GUI (Day 5 - Learn AI Agents)

## Overview  
This project is a **minimal travel booking agent** built with Python’s Tkinter GUI.  
It asks the user for **destination**, **budget**, and **number of people**, then displays **available flights and hotels**.  

**Everything in this project is hardcoded** — there is no API or real booking system involved.  
The goal was to create the simplest possible GUI flow for demonstration.

## How It Works  
- **Step 1:** User enters:  
  - Destination  
  - Budget  
  - Number of people  
- **Step 2:** The program displays:  
  - Hardcoded flight options  
  - Hardcoded hotel options  
- **Step 3:** Clicking **Book Flight** or **Book Hotel** shows a simple **"Booked!"** confirmation.

## Note  
- All data is **hardcoded and simulated** for this task.  
- Replace the hardcoded lists with **real API calls** to make it functional.
