This week was all about showcasing and shaping the road ahead.
We kicked things off by presenting our final projects, wrapping up the core internship deliverables.

The remainder of the week turned into an engaging round of team-wide discussions and knowledge-sharing â€” exploring what to learn next to keep our momentum going.

After a week of insights, debates, and suggestions, weâ€™ve arrived at two exciting paths for our next chapter:

ðŸ¤– AI Agents â€“ Building autonomous, task-driven systems.

ðŸ›  AI Engineering â€“ Designing and deploying robust AI solutions.
