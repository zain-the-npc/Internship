#  TypeRush â€” Final Internship Project  
**ProSensia Python Internship â€“ Day 25: Capstone Reflection**

---

##  Whatâ€™s This?

As part of the **final days** of the internship, we were asked to present our capstone project and reflect on what we learned. This is that reflection.

##  What I Learned

Working on **TypeRush** gave me a proper look at what it takes to turn an idea into something people can actually use. It wasnâ€™t just about writing code â€” it was about pulling together logic, design, and usability.

Hereâ€™s what I took away:

- How to build something end-to-end, even with bugs and rough edges  
- How to design with users in mind, not just functionality  
- How to spot what feels off â€” and fix it  
- How to stay consistent and finish what I start  

It also made me a lot more comfortable with debugging, polishing, and adapting quickly when things didnâ€™t work the first time.

##  Why It Mattered

This wasnâ€™t just another project â€” it was a solo build where I had to figure things out on my own.  
That helped me:

- Get better at decision-making  
- Handle setbacks without getting stuck  
- Think about the bigger picture â€” not just the code

##  Thanks

Appreciate the guidance and freedom from the **ProSensia** team throughout the internship.
