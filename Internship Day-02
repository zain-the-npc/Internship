                                                         ## This is the day 2 task of my internship in python at prosensia.

                                                        ## part 2 of task

                                                        ## asking user for 2 inputs      (Asking Directly in a non-string format using "float()")


num1=float(input('Enter First Number'))
num2=float(input('Enter Second Number'))


                                                        ## basic calculator functions implementation


sum_=num1+num2
product=num1*num2
remainder=num1-num2
quotient=num1/num2


                                                        ## printing all the answers using f statements.


print(f'The sum of the two numbers is {sum_}')
print(f'The remainder of the two numbers is {remainder}')
print(f'The Product of the two numbers is {product}')
print(f'The Quotient of the two numbers is {quotient} ')
